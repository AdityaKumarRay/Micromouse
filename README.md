## Algorithms
The Micromouse leverages advanced pathfinding algorithms to navigate mazes efficiently. This section provides an overview of the key algorithms implemented in the system.

### Flood-Fill Algorithm
The Flood-Fill algorithm is a grid-based approach commonly used in maze-solving robots. It involves assigning values to each cell in the maze based on their distance from the destination. The robot uses these values to navigate toward the goal.

- **Initialization:**  
  The maze is initialized with high values, and the goal cell is set to zero.

- **Value Propagation:**  
  Values are propagated outward from the goal cell, incrementing by one for each step.

- **Navigation:**  
  At each intersection, the robot chooses the cell with the lowest value, ensuring it moves toward the destination efficiently.

These algorithms work in tandem with the Micromouse's sensors and actuators to achieve efficient and reliable maze navigation.
